This document details 3 implementations: the electric guitar/bass pre-amplifier, the very high voltage probe and the input stage of a loudspeaker amplifier.

An additional input stage using field effect transistors could have been added, but it is not the topic here.


Electric guitar/bass pre-amplifier
----------------------------------

The goal is to supplied with a single 9V battery.
The voltage gain is maximum 2.
The input impedance should be at least 200K, but it is better to have 1meg.
The output impedance is slightly high at 600 or 1000 Ohms.
For many home equipments, an attenuator is required.
The first frequency is 30.868Hertz for the B0 note of the 5 and 6 strings basses.

D2 and D3 are omitted.
The output voltage limiter is omitted.
An additional daughter board has to be designed.
* It contains an active virtual ground. Two connector should be at the same location than the U1 and U2 regulators footprints, that are omitted.
* It contains 2 red LED (inside the virtual ground circuit for consumption reasons).
* It contains the attenuator to provide 2 outputs, one at +4dB for the professional equipments and one at -15dB for the home equipment.
* It contains input and output DC component removal capacitors.
* Some resistors should be adapted to the +-4.5V



Very high voltage probe
-----------------------
It is supplied by the power coming from the oscilloscope or an external supply. The wires should be as thin as possible.
The voltage gain is 5.
The input impedance is 2K for 20KV probes that contains a 100meg resistor.
The output impedance is 50 Ohms.
It should pass the DC component but the offset is not that critics.

The voltage regulators U1 and U2 are +-12V. Since there is a need of thin wires, they guarantee the correct voltage.
The voltage limiter is implemented as there are no output power transistors and the current in Q7 and Q8 should be limited to less than about 50mA.
The offset compensation is omitted as the offset current on a 2K resistor is low and there are still some oscilloscopes that does not display where the 0 is.



Loudspeaker amplifier
---------------------

It is supplied by the main power supply. The multiple boards is common for stereo and/or 3 ways, U1 and U2 voltage regulators can be omitted if there is a regulation for all of them.
The voltage gain is slightly low as most modern delta sigma DAC converters for audio purpose issue 1 or 2 volts.
The input impedance can be low as most modern delta sigma DAC converters for audio purpose have 100 Ohms or less output impedance.
The output impedance (this project with the output stages) should be as low as possible in order to "hold" the loudspeaker.
The DC component is optional.
