This is a FUN project to recreate an operational amplifier



There is a stage by stage description file and an applications file.



One extreme is the amplifier with a gain close to the infinite. Its close loop make it a theoretically very good amplifier. However, some stability drawbacks may occur.

The other extreme is the amplifier with the high tech linearity technology and the relevant gain.

This is a discrete solution to try to find the best compromise. The linearity is not that bad and the gain is low.



The goal is to design a schematic diagram and a PCB to produce an amplifier, that can customized by changing some values or (not)wiring some components. There are many "jumper style" connectors in order to access to some signals and to design a daughter board for some additional components.

The negative feedback is a current one, not a voltage one.

The signal transistors are the that300, 320 and 340 matched transistors from the company Thatcorp.

There are two options for the schematic, 0 resistors have to be implemented or not, in order to configure.
