This is a FUN project to recreate an operational amplifier

The goal is to design a schematic diagram and a PCB to produce an amplifier, that can customized by changing some values or (not)wiring some components.
The negative feedback is a current one, not a voltage one.
The signal transistors are the that300, 320 and 340 matched transistors from the company Thatcorp.
There are two options for the schematic, 0 resistors have to be implemented or not, in order to configure.

There is a stage by stage description file and an applications file.
